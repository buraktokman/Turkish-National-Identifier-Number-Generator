Turkish Identification Number (Turkish: Türkiye Cumhuriyeti Kimlik Numarası or abbreviated as T.C. Kimlik No.) is a unique personal identification number that is assigned to every citizen of Turkey.

**Verification of the Identification Number**

The identification number is a unique 11-digit number given by the MERNIS computer on the basis of the citizen's registration record that is kept by the registration office.

The number does not reflect any personal information about the citizen. It is not possible to change the identification number once applied.

The personal identification number is composed of numbers only and can not have a leading zero. The rightmost two digits of the 11-digit identification number are check digits added to enable error detection.

This Java program creates a valid Turkish Identification Number.
